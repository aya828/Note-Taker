# Note Taker

This note taker application can write, save, and delete notes so users can organize thoughts and keep track of tasks that need to be completed.

Write a title for each note and the context under the title. Then, the save icon will appear in the upper right hand corner. Once saved, the note will appear in the left column. Once the note is no longer needed, click the trash can to delete the note.
