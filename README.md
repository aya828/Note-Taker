# Note Taker

This application can write, save, and delete notes so users can organize thoughts and keep track of tasks that need to be completed.

Write a title for each note and the context under the title. Then, an icon will appear in the upper right hand corner to save the note. Once saved, the note will appear in the left column. Once the note is no longer needed or the task is complete, click the trash can to delete the note.
